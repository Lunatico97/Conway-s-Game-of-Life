# Conway-s-Game-of-Life
Built CGOL using C++ !
- Warning: I thought that cells randomizing color would look lovely haha !
- I built it few years back and just uploaded on my nostalgic journey of my old computer !
- Use Bloodshed Dev C++ IDE to instantly load this project and run ! But of course, it is not required ! What you will need is SDL2 package !
